description: Use OpenAI Codex CLI as a second-opinion agent for verification, exploration, and analysis tasks. Invoke when the user asks to verify assumptions, get a second opinion, cross-check analysis, explore alternatives, or use Codex for read-only analysis. Triggers on phrases like "verify with codex", "get a second opinion", "cross-check", "have codex analyze", "explore with codex".

# Codex Verifier

Delegates verification, analysis, and exploration tasks to OpenAI's Codex CLI as a second-opinion agent.

## When to use `codex exec`

Use `codex exec` when you want Codex to:

- Run as part of a pipeline (CI, pre-merge checks, scheduled jobs).
- Produce output you can pipe into other tools (for example, to generate release notes or summaries).
- Run with explicit, pre-set sandbox and approval settings.

## First: Get Current CLI Syntax

Run this at the start to ensure you have current options:

```bash
codex exec --help
```

## Basic usage

Pass a task prompt as a single argument:

```bash
codex exec "summarize the repository structure and list the top 5 risky areas"
```

While `codex exec` runs, Codex streams progress to `stderr` and prints only the final agent message to `stdout`. This makes it straightforward to redirect or pipe the final result:

```bash
codex exec "generate release notes for the last 10 commits" | tee release-notes.md
```

## Make output machine-readable

To consume Codex output in scripts, use JSON Lines output:

```bash
codex exec --json "summarize the repo structure" | jq
```

When you enable `--json`, `stdout` becomes a JSON Lines (JSONL) stream so you can capture every event Codex emits while it's running. Event types include `thread.started`, `turn.started`, `turn.completed`, `turn.failed`, `item.*`, and `error`.

Item types include agent messages, reasoning, command executions, file changes, MCP tool calls, web searches, and plan updates.

Sample JSON stream (each line is a JSON object):

```jsonl
{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"0199a213-81c0-7800-8aa1-bbab2a035a53"}
{"type":"turn.started"}
{"type":"item.started","item":{"id":"item_1","type":"command_execution","command":"bash -lc ls","status":"in_progress"}}
{"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_3","type":"agent_message","text":"Repo contains docs, sdk, and examples directories."}}
{"type":"turn.completed","usage":{"input_tokens":24763,"cached_input_tokens":24448,"output_tokens":122}}
```

If you only need the final message, write it to a file with `-o <path>`/`--output-last-message <path>`. This writes the final message to the file and still prints it to `stdout` (see [`codex exec`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference#codex-exec) for details).

## Create structured outputs with a schema

If you need structured data for downstream steps, use `--output-schema` to request a final response that conforms to a JSON Schema.
This is useful for automated workflows that need stable fields (for example, job summaries, risk reports, or release metadata).

`schema.json`

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "project_name": { "type": "string" },
    "programming_languages": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string" }
    }
  },
  "required": ["project_name", "programming_languages"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

Run Codex with the schema and write the final JSON response to disk:

```bash
codex exec "Extract project metadata" \
  --output-schema ./schema.json \
  -o ./project-metadata.json
```

Example final output (stdout):

```json
{
  "project_name": "Codex CLI",
  "programming_languages": ["Rust", "TypeScript", "Shell"]
}
```

## Command Pattern

Remember that the prompt should contain all necessary context for the task at hand; filepaths, code snippets, previously run commands, the path to the plan you are currently working on, etc.

Use `mktemp` to avoid output file collisions. Always redirect stderr to avoid polluting context with intermediate reasoning. Run `codex` in the background with a 15-minute timeout. Do not stop waiting for codex if it takes a long time.

```bash
OUTPUT_FILE=$(mktemp /tmp/codex-XXXXXX)
codex exec --json --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --output-last-message "$OUTPUT_FILE" "Your verification prompt here" 2>/dev/null
cat "$OUTPUT_FILE"
```
