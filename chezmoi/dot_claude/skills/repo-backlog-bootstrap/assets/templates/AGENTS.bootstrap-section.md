## Repo Bootstrap Standards

Use plan tool to track tasks. Use jujutsu (`jj`) for version control. Use independent sub-agents as needed.
If available in this Codex session, use the `$jujutsu` skill for command semantics.

Use `jj` to look at previous few commits to get a sense of recent changes. Analyze recently created open tasks to get a sense of planned work. If there is duplication of work between open tasks, think about how to refactor and consolidate the tasks.

- Fast iteration: `mise run dev` (wire this task to format + lint + test for this repo).
- Keep work scoped to backlog tasks with clear acceptance criteria.
- Keep task implementation details and verification steps current while coding.
