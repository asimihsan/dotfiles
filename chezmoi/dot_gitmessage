# Type can be 
#    feat     (new feature)
#    fix      (bug fix)
#    refactor (refactoring production code)
#    style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#    docs     (changes to documentation)
#    test     (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
#    chore    (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
# --------------------
# Remember to
#    Capitalize the subject line
#    Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#    Do not end the subject line with a period
#    Separate subject from body with a blank line
#    Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#    Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
# --------------------
# Scope is optional, but if used, should describe the area of the codebase affected:
#    auth     (authentication-related changes)
#    api      (API-related changes)
#    ui       (user interface components)
#    db       (database-related changes)
#    config   (configuration files)
# --------------------
# For a full example:
# 
# feat(auth): implement JWT authentication
# 
# - Add JWT token generation in auth service
# - Implement token validation middleware
# - Update user model to include token field
# 
# This change provides secure authentication for our API endpoints,
# allowing us to protect sensitive routes and improve overall system security.
# 
# Closes #123
